                <p>
                    <strong>Zeply</strong> is a versatile financial provider with B2B and B2C products.
                    Here I created a new era of operation from scratch providing an easily extendable
                    and affordable IaC system, and started to port multiple applications into that.

                    <strong>TIDEFI</strong> is an emerging decentralized crypto exchange with a strong focus on
                    security and accessibility. Here we did maintain our own blockchain based on Substrate. <br/>

                <br/><span class="tech">AWS, Terraform</span>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hashiah</strong> is a consulting company with a strong implementation direction.
                    With this entity, I consult every aspect of my clients and do my best efforts to solve their
                    different problems.<br/>
                    Mostly it is about building whole multi-environment infrastructures from scratch, rethinking
                    applications in a cloud-native manner.<br/>
                    I gained experience in several industrial fields, like <b>travel</b>, <b>gaming</b>, <b>logistics</b>,
                    <b>mobile development</b>

                <span class="lieu">Budapest</span>
                <span class="dates">2021.03 - 2021.09</span>
                <br/><span class="tech">AWS, Kubernetes, GitLab-CI, PHP, Drupal, Solr, Aurora, EasyRedmine</span>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cheppers</strong> is an AWS partner company. Here we did a lot of planning,
                    architectural design, and experimenting with different state-of-the-art technologies,
                    including the GitOps approach. <br/>
                    We had a lot of clients to deal with, and with their diverse problems, and besides that,
                    I made some efforts to reach the next tier at AWS.<br/>
                    I did webinars, people management, and client meetings too.

                <br/><span class="tech">PHP, Yii, UML, c4model, Jenkins, MySQL, Jira</span>
                <p>
                    <strong>Login</strong> has a very complex employee system with a bunch of custom functions that the
                    clients were asking for. My role here was to find a way to rebuild the legacy software in a better
                    way, eliminate bottlenecks and create a fitting solution that is scalable and maintainable.<br/>
                    After a little time, I needed to take up the Engineering Manager role too.

                <h4><strong>Freelance</strong> - Web Developer / DevOps Engineer</h4>

                <p>
                    <b>TÃ¡rhelypark</b> was a domain registrar and hosting company, with some old legacy systems.
                    Here I implemented new features that communicated through some low-level API-s and adjust the
                    back-office system for compatibility reasons, with a slightly new workflow.<br/>
                    I needed to adjust the underlying infrastructure solution too, so I enhanced it with
                    containerization, and update the whole runtime to the newest one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>BRTH Systems</b> was a DevOps as a Service company with a few stable clients. Here we usually did
                    classic operation works and implementation of new features to the infrastructure as per client
                    requests. We worked mostly on AWS or on-premise Kubernetes.

                    Ruby on Rails, microservices, Heroku, PostgreSQL, GreenPlum, GCP, Jira
                </span>
                <p>
                    <strong>Emarsys</strong> is perhaps the most prominent player in the e-Marketing market.<br/>
                    Here my team dealt with a product called Smart Insight. This is a solution helping clients
                    understand their customers better with visual reports and hints to earn a higher customer
                    lifecycle and ROI.

                <br/><span class="tech">Ruby on Rails, Heroku, PostgreSQL, AWS, UML, Jira, Trello</span>
                <p>
                    <strong>TerraCycle</strong> quasi-created an industry for itself. They collect waste and recycle
                    that to useful products.<br/>
                    Our team was responsible for operating the infrastructure of TerraCycle in 25 countries what
                    included the continuous development of the customer-facing website and the backend systems like
                    shipping logistics and charity administration.

                <p>
                    <strong>Ingatlan.com</strong> is the market-leader advertising site for real-estate back in Hungary.
                    I worked here on several projects using several technologies. I was a leader of a development team
                    for a while, but my longest assignment was on the back-office moderation system.<br/>
                    The purpose of this system was to reduce fraudulent advertisements by comparing text content and
                    image histograms to existing or past ones.<br/>
                    As a side project, we have been working on an AI which learned to categorize user messages based on
                    their intentions by analyzing the word usage and structure of messages.

                    <strong>KÃ¶telezÅ.hu</strong> was a second-in-market company between the insurance brokers. The main
                    focus was on vehicle liability insurance.<br/>
                    Here we have been aggregating data from more than ten third party insurance providers, calculating,
                    and selling the best offers to the clients in an almost completely automatized way.
